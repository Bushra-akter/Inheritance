1.There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. 
2. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java using Interface. 
3.Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
4.it can be used to achieve loose coupling.
5.all the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and are public and all fields are public, static, and final by default.

6.   class -- class,interface-- interface====extends
7.   class --- interface===implements


8. difference between class and interface:
     1.you can instantiate variables and create an object.	In an interface, you canâ€™t instantiate variables and create an object.                       
     2.A class can contain concrete (with implementation) methods	The interface cannot contain concrete (with implementation) methods.
     3.The access specifiers used with classes are private, protected, and public.	In Interface only one specifier is used- Public.
